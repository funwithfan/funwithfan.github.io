Hi, I’m Jingcun Fan — a postdoctoral researcher in Professor [Matthias Ihme's group](http://fxlab.stanford.edu/) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University, 

I earned my B.E. from East China University of Science and Technology in 2015. After receiving my Ph.D. in Solid Mechanics from the University of Science and Technology of China under the supervision of Professor [HengAn Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X4lTQbMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao\) and Professor [FengChao Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q0HxVyUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in 2020, I stayed in the group as postdoctoral researcher before joining Stanford.



Thank you for visiting my website. Please feel free to reach out if you’re interested in my work or potential collaborations.
